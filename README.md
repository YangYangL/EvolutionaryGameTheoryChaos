EvolutionaryGameTheoryChaos
===========================

This is my implementation of an evolutionary game theory simulation published in Nature, October 29, 1992 by
Martin A. Nowack, and Robert M. May, titled "Evolutionary Games and Spatial Chaos."

It works by calculating generations and saving them to text files. These text files are then read and visually represented
using SFML.

Some known limititions are the time it takes to calculate particularly large grids, and the time it takes to read them.
